Week08 — Day05: FinOps in Production (Spend SLOs & Auto-Controls)

Save as: wk08/day05_finops_prod_controls.md

CXO Lens: We make cost boring. Live spend SLOs, anomaly alerts, and automatic dials (routing, cache, truncate) keep invoices predictable.

Objectives

Activate spend SLOs by use case/provider/model with monthly caps.

Turn on auto-controls: dynamic routing, prompt compression, cache policy.

Publish savings scoreboard (target vs. actual).

Activities

Spend SLOs (25m) — Caps, 75/90/100% thresholds, actions.

Auto-Controls (25m) — Rule engine ties levers to SLO & budget.

Scoreboard (15m) — UCR trend, savings unlocked, next levers.

Deliverables

wk08/finops/spend_slo.yaml — caps, thresholds, actions.

wk08/finops/auto_controls.md — routing/cache/truncate rules.

wk08/finops/savings_scoreboard.csv — weekly updated.

Acceptance & QA

First month forecast ±5% vs plan; alerts tested.

Auto-controls reduce UCR ≥10% without SLO regressions.

Finance receives weekly roll-ups (chart + commentary).
