Week08 — Day07: Executive Scale Readout — Wave Performance & Next Capital Call

Save as: wk08/day07_exec_scale_readout_next_capital_call.md

CXO Lens: We treat scale like a portfolio. We show value realized, risk posture, cost control, and ask for the next capital call with conviction—or pause with discipline.

Why this matters (board rationale)

Evidence over aspiration: We report outcomes, not promises.

Guardrails honored: Scale did not compromise SLOs, safety, or privacy.

Capital efficiency: Dollars moved to the highest-return paths.

Objectives (today)

Present Wave performance (value, SLOs, incidents, cost).

Decide Expand / Hold / Retire per use case; reallocate capital.

Approve next 90-day plan and Enablement boosts.

Agenda (⏱ 75–90 minutes)

Readout (20m) — value realized, SLO adherence, incident summary, UCR trend.

Decisions (25m) — Expand/Hold/Retire; budget shifts; hiring updates.

Next 90 (20m) — Outcomes, waves, enablement, risk work-offs.

Comms (10–25m) — CEO note, ELT bullets, customer-safe stories.

Decision criteria (traffic-light v2)
Dimension	Expand	Hold	Retire
Value	≥ target with stat-sig	Trending up; CI overlaps	Below hurdle; no path
SLOs	Met with headroom	Tight; fixable ≤ 30 days	Chronic breaches
Safety	Evals green	Yellow w/ plan	Red / privacy risk
Economics	UCR ↓ q/q; within ±5% forecast	±15% with levers	Uncapped / opaque
Adoption	≥ target DAU, >70% task success	Slow uptake; UX issues	Low utility / trust

Acceptance & QA

Decisions logged in 24h with budgets, owners, and evidence.

Next-90 plan approved; calendars & dashboards updated.

CEO/ELT comms queued; Champions briefed on new focus areas.

What “great” looks like

Outcomes first: We can point to specific hours saved, revenue unlocked, or risk reduced.

Cost discipline: Spend SLOs held; UCR trending down with documented levers.

Operational calm: Incidents rare, small, and closed fast; rollback is muscle memory.
