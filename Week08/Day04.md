Week08 — Day04: Observability at Scale (Error Budgets & SLO Enforcement)

Save as: wk08/day04_observability_slo_enforcement.md

CXO Lens: What we don’t observe, we can’t govern. We enforce error budgets and make drift & cost visible in near-real time.

Objectives

Promote SLO dashboards to prod; add error budget policies.

Wire drift & data-quality alerts into on-call rotations.

Stand up weekly Ops Review: SLO, incidents, RCA, improvement plan.

Activities

Dashboards (25m) — p95 latency, error rate, cache hit, depth-k, UCR.

Budgets (20m) — Error budget burn policy → feature freeze/levers.

Drift & DQ (20m) — PSI/KS tests; null rules; freshness SLA and paging.
