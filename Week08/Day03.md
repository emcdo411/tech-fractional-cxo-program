Week08 — Day03: Privacy Attestations & Audit Pack (DPIA → Proof)

Save as: wk08/day03_privacy_attestations_audit_pack.md

CXO Lens: Private AI earns trust through evidence. We produce DPIA/SRA, data-flow maps, and deletion proofs that withstand board and regulator scrutiny.

Objectives

Complete DPIA/SRA and update RoPA (records of processing).

Finalize data-flow & residency diagrams; vendor sub-processor review.

Automate DSR (access/delete) proofs with artifact IDs.

Activities

DPIA/SRA (30m) — Purpose, lawful basis, risks, mitigations, residual risk.

Data-Flow (20m) — Source→Feature→Model→Product; cross-border paths.

DSR Automation (15m) — Propagation tests; proof artifacts; SLA alarms.

Deliverables

wk08/privacy/dpia.md • wk08/privacy/ropa.md

wk08/privacy/data_flow.png • wk08/privacy/residency_matrix.md

wk08/privacy/dsr_automation.md — API, queue, proof samples.

Acceptance & QA

DPIA signed by Legal, CISO, DPO; residual risks documented.

Deletion request proof in ≤72h with artifact ID.

Sub-processor list updated; contracts reference data ownership & egress.
