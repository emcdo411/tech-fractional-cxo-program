# Week06 — Day02: LLMOps — Evaluation Harness, Versioning & Drift (CXO Edition)

> **CXO Lens (Deloitte-grade):** Today we make **quality, safety, and reproducibility** non-negotiable. We will ship an **evaluation operating system** (offline + online) with **promotion gates**, **error budgets**, and **rollbacks**. Everything is versioned (prompts/models/data), explainable, and audit-ready.

---

## Objectives
- Stand up a **tiered evaluation harness** (offline regression → canary/online) with **golden sets**, **synthetic complements**, and **guardrail tests**.
- Establish **artifact versioning** for **prompts / models / datasets** with **semantic versions, checksums, lineage, and release notes**.
- Implement **drift & abuse monitoring** (input, embedding, output) with **escalation paths**, **freeze policy**, and **auto-rollback**.

---

## Lesson Summary
Quality must be **testable and repeatable**. We codify how changes are **proposed → measured → promoted**, minimizing regressions and audit risk. The harness blends **objective metrics** (exactness, latency, cost) with **human/LLM-as-judge scores** (groundedness, helpfulness, safety), then enforces **gates** before any production exposure.

---

## Activities (⏱ 90 minutes)
1) **Harness Design (35m)**  
   - Define **user journeys** (copilot answer, extraction, routing) and map to metrics.  
   - Build **golden sets** per domain; add **synthetic variants** to stress long-tail and jailbreaks.  
   - Choose scoring stack: **reference metrics** (BLEU/ROUGE/exact), **judged metrics** (SME / calibrated LLM-judge), **guardrails** (toxicity/PII/jailbreak).

2) **Versioning & Release Policy (25m)**  
   - Create **Prompt Registry** (SemVer + changelog + schema), **Dataset Registry** (hashes + provenance), **Model Registry** (IDs + weights/policies).  
   - Define **promotion flow**: PR → CI eval → **offline pass** → **canary 5–10%** → **A/B** → full rollout; with rollback criteria.

3) **Monitoring & Drift (30m)**  
   - Instrument **telemetry schema** (inputs/outputs/features/scores/cost/latency).  
   - Configure **drift detectors**: PSI/KL on features, **cosine shift** on embeddings, **moving-window quality** and **guardrail hit-rates**.  
   - Write **on-call runbook**: thresholds → page routes → freeze/revert.

---

## Acceptance & QA (evidence-based)
- **CI harness runs** on every PR; **baseline scores recorded**; **fail gates** defined & enforced.  
- **Artifacts** (prompt/model/dataset) use **semantic versions** with **checksums & changelogs**; a **rollback path** is documented and tested.  
- **Drift alerts** route to on-call; **abuse/jailbreak events** triaged & logged; **freeze policy** exercised in a tabletop.  
- One **canary promotion** executed with **A/B readout** (effect size + CI) and decision rationale.

## Metrics & Pass Bars (example)

| Category     | Metric                      | Target / Gate                    | Notes                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Exactness    | Exact match / EM            | ≥ **0.80** on golden where ref   | Deterministic tasks only   |
| Groundedness | SME/LLM-judge (1–5)         | ≥ **4.2/5** avg, no tail < 3/5   | Requires citations for RAG |
| Helpfulness  | SME/LLM-judge (1–5)         | ≥ **4.3/5**                      |                            |
| Safety       | Toxicity/PII/Jailbreak rate | **0 Sev-1**, Sev-2 ≤ **0.5%**    | Guardrail service enforced |
| Latency      | p95                         | ≤ **1200 ms** (journey: copilot) |                            |
| Cost         | Unit cost / request         | ≤ **\$0.012**                    | FinOps telemetry           |

> **Error Budgets:** e.g., Availability 99.9% ⇒ 0.1% budget. Breach ⇒ **feature freeze + stability sprint**.

## Model Versioning Policy (highlights)

* **SemVer** across **model**, **prompt**, **dataset**; **composite release tag**: `model@1.4.2 + prompt@2.3.0 + data@golden_2025_09`.
* **ADR per release**: what changed, why, evidence (offline & online), risk assessment, rollback plan.
* **Promotion criteria**: offline pass **and** online uplift within **pre-registered effect size** (e.g., **≥ +8%** grounded score, **≤ +5%** cost variance), **no safety regression**.
* **Rollback**: one-click revert to last good composite; post-mortem within 48h.

---

## Drift & Abuse Monitoring (spec)

**Signals**

* **Input drift:** PSI/KL divergence on features (topic, length, language).
* **Embedding drift:** mean vector cosine shift vs trailing window.
* **Output drift:** moving-avg of quality scores, refusal rates, guardrail hits.
* **Abuse:** jailbreak patterns, prompt-injection heuristics, surge in blocked requests.

**Thresholds & Actions**

* **Yellow:** early warning (investigate within 24h).
* **Red:** page on-call; **auto-freeze** affected route; evaluate rollback or guardrail update.

**Telemetry Schema (excerpt)**

```yaml
event_id: uuid
timestamp: iso8601
journey: copilot|extract|route
model: "cust-copilot-1.3.4"
prompt_version: "2.3.0"
dataset_version: "golden_2025_09"
latency_ms: 734
cost_usd: 0.0068
guardrail: {toxicity:false, pii:false, jailbreak:false}
scores: {exact:0.82, grounded_judge:4.4}

```

---

## Online Experiment Design

* Prefer **interleaving** for ranking/quality tasks; A/B for deterministic extraction.
* **Power target** ≥ 0.8; pre-register primary metric; set **stop-loss** (e.g., groundedness −5%).
* **Decision memo** auto-generated with effect size, CI, cost delta, and safety outcomes.

---

## Governance & Compliance Essentials

* **PII policy:** redact pre-eval; use **de-identified** eval logs; retention windows.
* **Model Risk:** document evaluation scope, validation independence for high-risk routes.
* **Auditability:** immutable logs of **prompt/model/data versions**, metrics, and gate decisions (12–18 mo).

---

## RACI (for this capability)

* **Responsible:** MLOps (harness & CI), Data Science (metrics & golden sets), SRE (monitoring/on-call)
* **Accountable:** Head of Platform AI
* **Consulted:** Security/Privacy, Finance (FinOps), Product
* **Informed:** ELT, Legal

---

## What “Great” Looks Like (Harvard/MIT CXO rubric)

* **Reproducible:** Any score can be re-run from versions & checksums.
* **Controllable:** Gates + error budgets + rollbacks are **enforced**, not aspirational.
* **Explainable:** Decision memos link to raw evals and telemetry.
* **Sustainable:** Quality gains tracked **with** unit-cost and safety; regressions stop at canary.

---

## Timebox & Follow-ups

* **⏱ 90 min total:** 35 harness • 25 versioning • 30 monitoring.
* **Within 48h:** first CI run on a sample PR; publish dashboards & paging test.
* **Within 7 days:** first canary promotion using this process with a signed decision memo.
