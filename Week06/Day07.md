# Week06 — Day07: Executive Readout — Operating Model 2.0 & Roadmap Q+2 (CXO Edition)

## Objectives
- Present **Week06 outcomes** and decide **Operating Model 2.0** (roles, cadences, budgets).
- Refresh **OKRs** and **roadmap for next two quarters**; reallocate capital to winners.
- Confirm **hiring/upskilling plan** and **cross-functional governance**.

## Lesson Summary
We leave Week06 with decisions, owners, and dates. The operating model scales what works and stops what doesn’t.

## Activities (⏱ 75–90 min)
- **Readout (20m):** Wins, risks, exceptions; ROI vs plan.
- **Model 2.0 (25m):** RACI, calendar, committees; tool & data ownership.
- **Roadmap (25m):** Q+1/Q+2 priorities; dependency & risk register.
- **People (10–20m):** Hiring plan, training, champions.
