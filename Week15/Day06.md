CXO Lens: We require SBOM, signature verification, and plugin vetting for agents.

Objectives

Build SBOM for AI stack; sign artifacts.

Vet plugins/tools with threat models.

Set patch SLAs and code provenance.

Activities

SBOM (25m) — components + versions.

Vetting (20m) — plugin/tool review.

Provenance (20m) — signatures + attestations.

SLAs (10–25m) — patch timelines.

Deliverables

security/sbom.json • security/plugin_vetting_checklist.md

security/provenance_policy.md • security/patch_slas.md

Acceptance & QA

SBOM complete; plugins approved; signatures enforced in CI.
