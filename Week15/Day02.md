Save as: wk15/day02_incentives_kpis_gaming_resistance.md

CXO Lens: Bad metrics get gamed. We align incentives to outcomes and build checks against metric manipulation.

Objectives

Align comp KPIs to value (not vanity).

Add anti-gaming checks (e.g., source-of-truth counters).

Publish ethics & rewards policy.

Activities

KPI Audit (25m) — vanity vs value.

Controls (20m) — dual counters; random audits.

Comp (20m) — shared scorecards.

Comms (10–25m) — policy rollout.
