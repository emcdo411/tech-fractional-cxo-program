CXO Lens: We prevent automation bias by defining when AI must hand off to humans—and who decides.

Objectives

Document decision rights and HITL triggers.

Build escalation ladders and SLAs.

Instrument override telemetry.

Activities

RACI (25m) — per use case: allow/alert/approve.

Triggers (20m) — confidence, PII, cost, novelty.

Ladders (20m) — who, how, when; audit trail.

Telemetry (10–25m) — capture overrides.
