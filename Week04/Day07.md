# Week04 ‚Äî Day07: Weekly Review & Readiness Gate (CXO Edition)

## Objectives

* Validate that **Month One artifacts** are complete, consistent, and versioned.
* Score against **readiness gate criteria** and make a **Go / Conditional Go / No-Go** decision for the next phase.
* Convert remaining gaps into an **owned, dated action register**.

## Lesson Summary

End the month like an operator: confirm artifacts, score the gate, decide, and move. Evidence beats opinions‚Äîtie everything to files, dates, and owners. If anything is amber/red, proceed as **Conditional Go** with clear conditions and a re-check date.

## Activities (60‚Äì75 min)

1. **Artifact inventory (15 min):** Verify each Month One file exists, is versioned, and aligns with policies.
2. **Gate scoring (20 min):** Apply the criteria; score Pass/Partial/Fail (or 0/1).
3. **Gaps ‚Üí actions (15 min):** Assign owner, date, and acceptance test.
4. **Decision & comms (10‚Äì25 min):** Record Go/Conditional Go/No-Go, conditions, and next-phase kickoff date.

## Deliverables

* **Required**

  * `governance/week04_review_and_gate.md`
* **Recommended**

  * `governance/readiness_gate_criteria.csv`
  * `governance/artifact_inventory.csv`
  * `exec/weekly_brief_week04.md` (one-pager summary)
  * `exec/action_register.csv` (carry-forward actions)

## Acceptance & QA

* The review file lists **completed artifacts, gaps, and an explicit Go/No-Go** decision with sign-off.
* Readiness criteria include **owner, evidence link, and score**; **Conditional Go** items have **dated conditions**.

## 3) Findings & Gaps (Top Items)
| ID | Gap | Severity | Owner | Due | Acceptance Test |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---|
| KPI-01 | KPI catalog not fully defined | Med | FP&A | 2025-09-12 | `board/kpi_catalog.csv` complete; linked in pack |
| SEC-OTP | Two admins still on OTP | High | CISO | 2025-09-20 | FIDO2 enforced; attestation posted |

## 4) Decision
> **Choose one** and record conditions if Conditional Go.

- **Decision:** **Conditional Go**  
- **Conditions:**  
  1) **KPI-01** closed by **2025-09-12**  
  2) **SEC-OTP** closed by **2025-09-20**  
- **Re-check:** **2025-09-21** (10-min gate confirm in ELT)  
- **Next Phase Kickoff (tentative):** **2025-09-23**

**Sign-off:**  
- Chair: ________________________  Date: __________  
- CEO:   ________________________  Date: __________

- **Decision cycle time** (median, intake ‚Üí decision)  
- **Audit action closure rate** (by due date)  
- **AI high-risk gate compliance** (% of releases scored & reviewed)  
- **KPI catalog completeness** (100% of pack KPIs have owner, formula, target)
