# Week01 - Day07: Weekly Review and Quality Check

## Objectives
- Review Week01 artifacts for completeness and coherence.
- Prepare a short, stakeholder-ready status update.

## Lesson Summary
A weekly review keeps artifacts consistent and decision-ready. Close the loop with a concise update that names wins, risks, and a clear decision request.

## Activity
1) Run the checklist below across all Week01 files.  
2) Draft a status note with **one risk** and **one decision request**.

## Deliverable
- **File:** `operations/week01_review_and_status.md`  
- Sections: Completed, Risks, Decisions Needed, Next Focus.

## Acceptance & QA
- All Week01 deliverables exist and reference each other correctly.  
- Status note is decision-first, ≤150 words, and can be shared as-is.  
- One explicit decision request includes **owner + due date**.
