# Week01 - Day01: Orientation and CXO Role Mandate

## Objectives
- Understand program structure and portfolio outcomes.
- Define the fractional CXO mandate and boundaries.
- Set up repo folders for governance, finance, risk, and operations.

## Lesson Summary
Non-traditional CXOs win on decision quality and operating rhythm. This program builds board-ready artifacts in short cycles: learn → build → review.

## Activity
- Create folders: `governance/`, `finance/`, `risk/`, `operations/`.
- Draft a one-page **CXO Role Mandate** using the template below.

## Deliverable
- **File:** `governance/cxo_role_mandate.md`
- **Include:** scope, decision rights, time commitment, reporting cadence, success measures, key stakeholders.

## Acceptance & QA
- Scope and decision rights are explicit (what’s in/out).
- Success measures include **≥2 metrics** (e.g., “launch weekly business review by Day14; decision log live with ≥3 entries by Day21”).
- Stakeholders listed with a single **Accountable** owner.

## Suggested Assets
- Add placeholder diagrams in `assets/week01/` if helpful.

## Timebox
- 60–90 minutes
