# Week01 - Day06: Case Study and Reflection

## Objectives
- Apply Week01 artifacts to resolve a realistic scenario.
- Record lessons and concrete next steps.

## Lesson Summary
Use a brief case to stress-test your mandate, RACI, and charter. Reflection turns activity into improvement: what changed, why, and how you’ll verify it worked.

## Activity
1) Pick a scenario (decision conflict, unclear scope, urgent vendor choice).  
2) Walk through: **Role Mandate → Decision Rights → Charter** to resolve.  
3) Capture changes to artifacts (file paths + owners + dates).

## Deliverable
- **File:** `case-studies/week01_case_reflection.md`  
- Include: Situation, Analysis, Decision, Result (metric), Changes to artifacts, Follow-ups.

## Acceptance & QA
- Reflection lists **≥2 changes** with repo paths (e.g., `governance/decision_log.md`).  
- Result includes **one metric or observable outcome** (e.g., “decision in 48h”).  
- At least **one follow-up** has an owner and date.

## Case Reflection — Template

### Situation
- 3–5 sentences describing the conflict, constraints, and stakeholders.

### Analysis
- Which artifact guided the decision (mandate, RACI, charter)?  
- Options considered and thresholds involved.

### Decision
- The chosen option and rationale (tie to guardrails/KPIs).

### Result (Metric)
- Example: “Decision made in **2 biz days**; reduced rework tickets from **5 → 1**.”

### Changes to Artifacts
| File | Change | Owner | Due |
|---|---|---|---|
| `governance/governance_charter_v1.md` | Added tie-break rule | CIO | D08 |
| `governance/decision_rights_and_raci.md` | Raised vendor threshold to \$25k | COO | D08 |

### Follow-ups
- Stakeholder review scheduled for D10; verify effect in next WBR.
