# Week01 - Day05: Founder Alignment Brief

## Objectives
- Capture expectations on scope, communication, and decision process.
- Align on success criteria and guardrails (numerical thresholds).

## Lesson Summary
Alignment reduces churn and accelerates decisions. Make “what good looks like” explicit, including trade-off rules, cadence, and who decides what under which thresholds.

## Activity
1) Draft a one-page **Founder Alignment Brief** using the template below.  
2) Add **assumptions** and how you’ll **test** them (owner + date).  
3) Set **guardrails** (budget/time/risk thresholds) that trigger a re-plan.

## Deliverable
- **File:** `governance/founder_alignment_brief.md`  
- Headings: Context, Scope, Guardrails, Working Agreements, Success Measures, Assumptions & Tests.

## Acceptance & QA
- ≥2 assumptions stated **and** each has a test (owner + due date).  
- Success measures reference your repo KPIs (see `finance/kpi_tree.md`).  
- Guardrails include **numeric** thresholds (e.g., “>\$25k vendor → board review”).  
- Communication cadence and decision turnaround SLAs documented.

## Founder Alignment Brief — Template

### Context
- Problem/opportunity in one paragraph. Current constraints.

### Scope (In / Out)
- **In:** areas owned by CXO.  
- **Out:** areas explicitly not owned (and who owns them).

### Guardrails (Numeric)
- Budget: changes > **\$X** require [role] approval.  
- Timeline: slippage > **Y days** escalates to [role].  
- Risk: Sev-1 incidents trigger incident process within **15 min**.

### Working Agreements
- Channels (e.g., email/Slack), response times, doc locations, meeting hygiene.

### Decision Process
- Use decision memos; SLA to decide in **N business days**; tie-break role.

### Success Measures (tie to KPIs)
- Example: “WBR live with KPI pack by **D30**; decision log ≥ **3 entries** by **D30**.”

### Assumptions & Tests
| Assumption | Test | Owner | Due |
|---|---|---|---|
| Example: CRM data is reliable | Random sample of 30 records | Analytics | D14 |
| Example: Current vendor meets SOC2 | Obtain and review report | Security | D21 |

### Sign-off
- Founder acknowledgment (name/date).
