# Week01 - Day04: 30-60-90 Onboarding Plan

## Objectives
- Plan your first 90 days of impact.
- Tie onboarding tasks to measurable outcomes.

## Lesson Summary
Momentum beats perfection. Use 30-day sprints anchored to outcomes: visibility (30), control (60), repeatability (90). Each phase should have owners and metrics.

## Activity
1) Draft the plan using the table below.  
2) Add **metrics** (what moves) and **owners** (who moves it).  
3) List top risks per phase with mitigations.

## Deliverable
- **File:** `operations/onboarding_30_60_90.md`  
- Sections: Goals, Milestones, Risks, Owners, Metrics.

## Acceptance & QA
- Each phase shows ≥1 measurable result (e.g., “WBR live; decision log ≥3 entries”).  
- Risks include a mitigation and a date/owner.  
- Review checkpoints scheduled (calendar invites or notes).
