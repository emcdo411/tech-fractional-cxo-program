Week12 — Day06: Continuous Compliance & Audit Automation (Controls as Code)

Save as: wk12/day06_continuous_compliance_audit_automation.md

CXO Lens: We move from periodic audits to continuous controls monitoring. Evidence is collected automatically and mapped to frameworks (ISO/NIST/AI Act).

Objectives

Map control library (Week11) to framework requirements.

Implement evidence collectors (logs, screenshots, artifacts).

Automate control attestations and exception tracking.

Activities (⏱ 75–90m)

Control→Framework (25m) — ISO 27001, SOC2, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act.

Evidence Automation (20m) — APIs to pull proofs on schedule.

Attestation Cadence (20m) — Quarterly CSA, monthly exceptions.

Audit Pack (10–25m) — One-click export with indices & hashes.
