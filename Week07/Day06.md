# Week07 ‚Äî Day06: Change Management, Enablement & Champions Network

*Save as:* `wk07/day06_change_enablement_champions.md`

> **CXO Lens (Deloitte-grade):** Tools don‚Äôt transform companies‚Äî**people + rituals** do. We stand up a **repeatable enablement engine** and a **Champions network** that turns early wins into durable behavior change.

---

## Why this matters (board rationale)

* **Speed to value:** A trained, supported field reduces time-to-first-value and help-desk drag.
* **Risk control:** Consistent rituals (office hours, change stories, post-launch surveys) surface risks early.
* **Scalable culture:** Champions create peer-to-peer momentum that central teams alone can‚Äôt maintain.

---

## Objectives (today)

* Launch a **Champions network** per BU/region with **clear incentives and charter**.
* Publish **enablement paths** (101 ‚Üí role labs ‚Üí certs) and **office hours**.
* Establish **comms cadence** and **change stories** that travel across the org.

---

## Lesson Summary

Adoption requires **clarity** (what, why, when), **safety** (where to ask, how to revert), and **momentum** (wins, recognition). We wire **feedback loops** into every ritual so learnings cycle back into roadmaps and evals.
