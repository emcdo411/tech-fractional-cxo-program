# Week07 — Day06: Change Management, Enablement & Champions Network

> **CXO Lens:** Tools don’t transform companies—**people + rituals** do. We stand up a lightweight enablement engine and a **Champions** network per function.

---

## Objectives
- Launch a **Champions network** (per BU/region) with clear incentives.
- Publish **enablement paths** (101, role‑based labs, office hours).
- Establish **comms cadence** and **change stories** that travel.

---

## Lesson Summary
Adoption requires **clarity, safety, and momentum**. Give people the why, show the how, and celebrate the wins. Build feedback loops into every ritual.

---

## Activities (⏱ 75–90 minutes)
1) **Stakeholder Map (20m)**  
   - Who wins/loses? Map narratives and concerns.
2) **Enablement Plan (25m)**  
   - Curriculum, labs, certifications, office hours; assign **instructors**.
3) **Champions Charter (20m)**  
   - Role, incentives, recognition; monthly council.
4) **Comms Pack (10–25m)**  
   - Email templates, Slack posts, “What’s new” digest, demo day plan.

---

## Deliverables
- `wk07/enablement/plan.md` — paths, schedules, instructors.
- `wk07/champions/charter.md` — roles, incentives, calendar.
- `wk07/comms/starter_pack.zip` — email, Slack, slides.

---

## Acceptance & QA
- At least **1 Champion per function/region** with kickoff date.
- Office hours calendar published with **owner**.
- Comms pack localized for **two audiences** (ICs and leaders).
