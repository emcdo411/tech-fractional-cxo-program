# Week07 ‚Äî Day07: Executive Readout ‚Äî Pilot-to-Platform Go/No-Go

*Save as:* `wk07/day07_executive_readout_go_no_go.md`

> **CXO Lens (Deloitte-grade):** We turn Week07 artifacts into a **decision**: scale, sharpen, or stop. Every decision is time-boxed, owner-assigned, budgeted, and evidenced. No ‚Äúwe‚Äôll revisit later.‚Äù

---

## Why this matters (board rationale)

* **Focus:** Capital flows to **few, provable winners**; everything else exits gracefully.
* **Accountability:** Decisions and dollars tie to **SLOs, guardrails, and unit economics**‚Äînot vibes.
* **Repeatability:** A standard Go/No-Go ritual becomes the **operating rhythm** for AI investments.

---

## Objectives (today)

* Present **value scores**, **SLO readiness**, **MRM results**, and **unit economics** for top use cases.
* Decide **Go / Sharpen / Stop** for the top 3, with **budget shifts and owners**.
* Approve **Enablement & Champions** kickoff aligned to scaled use cases.

## Decision criteria (traffic-light)

| Dimension            | Green (Go)                                | Yellow (Sharpen)                    | Red (Stop)                      |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Value**            | Quantified ROI ‚â• hurdle; sponsor signed   | ROI plausible but baseline weak     | No clear value metric/sponsor   |
| **SLOs**             | Meets latency/reliability; on-call ready  | Minor gaps with ETA ‚â§ 30 days       | Gaps unknown or > 30 days       |
| **Safety (MRM)**     | Required evals pass; rollback tested      | 1‚Äì2 thresholds close; fixes planned | Material safety/privacy risks   |
| **Economics**        | Unit cost ‚â§ target; forecast within ¬±5%   | Within ¬±15% with clear levers       | Uncapped or non-traceable spend |
| **Data Trust**       | Contracts + lineage + deletion proofs     | 1‚Äì2 contracts pending (<30 days)    | No contracts/ownership gaps     |
| **Adoption/UX**      | Trust UX live; feedback loop wired        | Patterns drafted; copy pending      | No trust affordances            |
| **Change Readiness** | Champions named; enablement calendar live | Partial coverage; dates set         | No capacity to support scale    |

> **Rule:** Any **Red** ‚Üí Stop (or Sharpen to green within 30 days). Majority **Green** with no Red ‚Üí Go.

## Communications (ready-to-send)

**CEO note (internal):**

> Team ‚Äî we‚Äôre green-lighting **Ops Copilot** to Wave 2. Why: clear ROI, steady SLOs, proven safety, and predictable unit economics. Guardrails are unchanged; success looks like faster tasks with citations and stable costs. Champions will host office hours next week. Thank you to everyone who shipped the foundations.

**ELT brief (bullets):**

* Go: Ops Copilot; Sharpen: Customer Copilot (SLO gap); Stop: Legacy summarizer
* Budget shifts: +\$250k to Ops; ‚àí\$150k from Legacy; headcount +1 SRE (Q+1)
* Risks: EU privacy nuance ‚Üí contract update in progress (Legal/Sec)

**Champions announcement (Slack/Teams):**

> üöÄ Scaling Ops Copilot: Wave 2 starts <date>. Demo + Q\&A in #demo-day, office hours Wed 11:00. Post wins in #wins. Tag @Champions-Ops for fast help.

---

## Acceptance & QA

* All decisions **logged within 24h** with links to evidence and owners.
* Budgets/headcount updated in the **source of truth** (FP\&A + HR systems).
* CEO/ELT communications **reviewed and scheduled**; Champions calendar posted.

---

## Dashboards to monitor (post-decision)

* **Exec:** ROI vs plan; UCR trend; incidents; adoption curve.
* **Ops:** p95 latency/error rate; cache hit; depth-k distribution.
* **Safety:** eval pass rate; incident MTTR; red-team findings to closure.
* **Change:** lab completions; office-hour attendance; ticket deflection by Champions.

## What ‚Äúgreat‚Äù looks like

* **Clarity:** One page tells you *what we‚Äôre doing, why, who, and by when*.
* **Discipline:** Funding follows evidence; reds stop; yellows sharpen; greens scale.
* **Momentum:** Within one week, enablement is live, metrics move, and stories travel.
