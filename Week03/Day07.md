## Day07 — Weekly Review & Tabletop Summary (CXO Edition)

### Objectives
- Close the loop: validate **control coverage**, **risk updates**, and **incident readiness** via a short tabletop.
- Produce a concise report with **actions, owners, dates** and update artifacts.

### Lesson Summary
Operational excellence is a cadence. Use a 30-minute tabletop to expose gaps, then record decisions and update the system of record (controls, risks, playbooks).

### Activities
1) **Tabletop (30 min)**: Pick one playbook; run through a realistic scenario; record timeline & decisions.
2) **Gaps → Actions**: Convert gaps into tickets with owners & due dates.
3) **Update Artifacts**: If a control, risk, or playbook changed—commit the update.
4) **Metrics Refresh**: Recompute key KPIs (FIDO2 %, privileged minutes, EDR coverage, policy violations, Restore MTTR, MTTD, % SaaS on SSO/SCIM).

### Deliverables
- **security/week03_review_and_update.md**  
  Sections: Highlights, Control Status, Risks, Actions, Next Focus
- **tabletop/tabletop_timeline.csv** (timestamp, event, owner)
- **tabletop/action_register.csv** (action, owner, due, link)
- Updated **metrics/security_kpis.csv** (from Day02)

### Acceptance & QA
- **≥3 actions** with owners & dates; two tickets opened.
- At least one artifact updated (control, risk, or playbook) based on tabletop.
- Metrics refreshed and posted; deltas called out (↑/↓) with hypotheses.

### Timebox
- ⏱ 45 minutes
