Suggested filename: toolkit/fractional_cxo_daily_feed_prompt.md

Purpose

A copy-paste prompt that generates a 5-minute daily rundown for aspiring fractional CXOs from non-traditional backgrounds—plus two Top-Voice-style LinkedIn drafts (AM/PM). Designed for any AI tool with web access/browsing.

How to use

Open your browsing-enabled AI tool.

Paste the prompt below.

(Optional) Edit the Config block (region, sectors, tickers).

Publish the AM/PM LinkedIn drafts (keep links in the first comment).

Copy/Paste Prompt
Act as a **best-in-class fractional CXO** (AI/Data/Sec/Product) writing for ambitious operators from **non-traditional backgrounds**. Pull today’s most relevant items across:
1) AI policy & privacy (EU AI Act/GDPR/US regs),
2) Enterprise AI architecture (RAG, evals, guardrails, FinOps),
3) Security/zero-trust signals,
4) Market bellwethers (SPY, QQQ, MSFT, NVDA) & notable AI tickers,
5) Operator stories (case studies, failures, migrations).

OUTPUT EXACTLY THIS STRUCTURE:

I. Market Snapshot (≤90s read)
• Index/mega-cap moves (pre/close), 1-liner why it matters to operators.
• “3 fast stats” (e.g., GPU prices, model costs, hiring signals).

II. Must-Reads (3–5 items, ≤2 lines each, non-technical)
• Headline (plain English) — What happened → Why it matters → Operator takeaway.
• Source attribution (publisher + date). Put raw links in a “Sources” list at the end.

III. Tech Briefs (3 items, ≤2 lines each)
• Architecture/guardrails/evals/FinOps levers relevant to deployment.

IV. Signals & Watchlist (bullets)
• Policy moves, vendor changes, supply chain, notable outages/incidents.

V. Fast Exec Stats
• 3 quantified bullets (privacy adoption %, cost deltas, latency SLOs).

VI. 20-Minute Sprint (TL;DR / TL;DW)
• If you have 20 minutes: read X, skim Y, watch Z (each with 1-line “so what”).

VII. People Note
• 1 uplifting item for non-traditional builders (scholarship, fellowship, success story).

VIII. Two LinkedIn Drafts (Top-Voice style)
• AM Post (≤900 chars): tight hook + 3 value bullets + save/share cue + 3–5 niche hashtags.
• PM Post (≤900 chars): late-day angle (earnings/policy/launch) + 2 actionable takeaways + CTA.
• Keep links OUT of the post; provide a FIRST COMMENT block with sources + one smart question.
• Optimize for LinkedIn: strong hook, mobile line breaks, minimal emojis, niche hashtags, save/share triggers.
• OPTIONAL: After drafting, run the body through your “linkedin-optimizer” agent to refine per its rubric.

CONSTRAINTS
• Each item must be readable in ≤5 minutes.
• Summaries must be non-technical but precise (no hype).
• Cite sources by name/date; place raw URLs in a “Sources” list at the end.
• If facts conflict, note the discrepancy and default to the most primary/authoritative source.
• End with a 1-slide brief (bullets) that a CXO can paste into a standup.
