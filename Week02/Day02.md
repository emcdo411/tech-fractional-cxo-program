# Week02 - Day02: Runway Math Basics

## Objectives
- Calculate burn rate and runway in months
- Identify 3 levers that extend runway

## Lesson Summary
Runway = cash on hand / monthly net burn. Build a simple view anyone can read. Add base, conservative, aggressive sensitivity bands.

## Activity
- Fill monthly_burn_template.csv with 6â€“12 months of estimates
- Write a short note explaining assumptions and levers

## Deliverable
- Files: finance\runway_calc.md, finance\templates\monthly_burn_template.csv
- CSV columns: Month, CashStart, Inflows, Outflows, NetBurn, CashEnd

## Acceptance and QA
- Runway stated in months with assumptions listed
- At least 2 levers and expected impact called out

## Timebox
- 75 minutes
