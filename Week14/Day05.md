Week14 — Day05: Controls Testing & Continuous Assurance

Save as: wk14/day05_controls_testing_assurance.md

CXO Lens: We don’t hope controls work—we test them. Shift from point-in-time audits to continuous control monitoring.

Objectives

Define control library and test cadence.

Implement sampling plans and CCM for high-risk controls.

Publish assurance report with exceptions and fixes.

Activities

Library (25m) — privacy, access, MRM, change, vendor, FinOps.

Test Plans (20m) — evidence, frequency, sampling size.

CCM Hooks (20m) — alerts to #audit-watch.

Report (10–25m) — findings, severity, owners, ETAs.

Deliverables

assurance/control_library.md • assurance/test_plans/*.md
