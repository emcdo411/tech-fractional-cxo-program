Week14 — Day03: Economic Capital for AI Risk (Buffers & Hurdle Rates)

Save as: wk14/day03_economic_capital_hurdle_rates.md

CXO Lens: Translate risk into capital. We estimate expected loss (EL), unexpected loss (UL), and set buffers. We update hurdle rates for new AI bets.

Objectives

Build EL/UL model from incidents, stress tests, and expert priors.

Define risk buffers and hurdle rate for new investments.

Add capital charges to business cases.

Activities

Loss Modeling (25m) — distribution from incident history + scenarios.

Buffer Policy (20m) — tiered buffers by use case risk.

Hurdle Rate (20m) — return > (cost + buffer + opex).

Templates (10–25m) — business case with capital charge field.

Deliverables

risk/economic_capital_model.md • risk/buffer_policy.md

portfolio/hurdle_rates.md • portfolio/biz_case_template.md

Acceptance & QA

New investments include capital charge; ELT approves buffer policy.
