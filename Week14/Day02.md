Week14 — Day02: Stress Testing & Scenario Analytics (What Breaks, When)

Save as: wk14/day02_stress_testing_scenarios.md

CXO Lens: Like portfolio VAR, we simulate tail events: provider outage, token price spike, retrieval contamination, legal injunction. We quantify loss/latency/cost impacts and pre-approve actions.

Objectives

Define 5–7 stress scenarios with frequency/severity assumptions.

Run synthetic stress tests across top use cases (cost/SLO/safety).

Produce a pre-approved response matrix (what to pull, when).

Activities

Scenario Set (25m) — macro (cost spike), tech (outage), legal (injunction), safety (breakout).

Simulation (25m) — apply multipliers to UCR, latency, error; chart impacts.

Response Matrix (15m) — levers (routing, cache, truncate, pause).

Sign-off (10–25m) — CISO/CFO/CTO approval; publish runbook.

Deliverables

risk/stress_scenarios.md • risk/stress_results.csv

risk/response_matrix.md • finops/auto_triggers.yaml

Acceptance & QA

All top use cases have named response levers and auto-triggers.

Stress results reviewed with ELT and logged.
