Week14 — Day04: Model/System Cards & SR-11-7-Style Governance

Save as: wk14/day04_model_system_cards_sr11_7.md

CXO Lens: BlackRock had investment memos; we ship model/system cards with risks, data limits, evals, and controls—auditable like SR-11-7.

Objectives

Standardize model & system cards for top 5 assets.

Link to evidence: evals, lineage, guardrails, rollback proof.

Publish review cadence and storage in an evidence registry.

Activities

Template (25m) — purpose, data, risks, evals, limits, support.

Populate (25m) — top 5 models/agents/tools.

Registry (15m) — storage + versioning + permissions.

Cadence (10–25m) — quarterly review schedule.

Deliverables

mrm/templates/model_card.md • mrm/system_card.md

mrm/cards/*.md • governance/evidence_registry.md

Acceptance & QA

All top assets have signed cards with links to evidence; registry live.
