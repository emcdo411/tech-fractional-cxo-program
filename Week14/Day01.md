Week14 — Day01: Risk Taxonomy, KRIs & Dashboards (Quantify → Govern)

Save as: wk14/day01_risk_taxonomy_kris_dashboards.md

CXO Lens: If we can’t name risks, we can’t price them. We standardize a risk taxonomy for modern AI (model, data, privacy, safety, ops, vendor, legal) and wire KRIs into exec dashboards.

Objectives

Publish an AI Risk Taxonomy v1.0 and KRI catalog.

Define owner, banding (Green/Yellow/Red), and data source per KRI.

Launch an exec risk dashboard with weekly snapshots.

Activities (⏱ 75–90m)

Taxonomy Draft (25m) — 7 domains × sample risks × example loss events.

KRI Definition (20m) — formula, threshold bands, data lineage, owner.

Data Hooks (20m) — pull from SLO, FinOps, security, privacy, product.

Dashboard (10–25m) — build v1 tiles; schedule weekly refresh.

Deliverables
