Week05 — Day03: Automation Factory (RPA + iPaaS) with P&L Tie-In (CXO Edition)
Objectives

Stand up an Automation Operating Model: intake → scoring → build → monitor → measure savings.

Ship two automations tied to P&L (workflow + data sync) with rollback and observability.

Publish a financial benefits model (time saved × loaded rate; error reduction × cost).

Lesson Summary

Automation pays when it’s governed and measured. Create a lightweight factory with guardrails and a scoreboard executives trust.

Activities (90–120 min)

Intake & scoring (25m): Backlog form + ROI scoring.

Build two flows (45–60m): One workflow/RPA; one data sync; add alerts and rollbacks.

Measure (20m): Baseline → after; publish savings & quality lift.

Runbooks (10–15m): On-call, rollback, change control.

ops/automation_intake.csv (candidate list w/ business owner)

ops/automation_scorecard.csv (ROI / risk / effort)

ops/automation_playbooks.md + ops/flow_runbooks.md

metrics/automation_benefits.csv (before/after metrics)

Acceptance & QA

2 flows in production with monitoring + rollback and ≥ 30% time saved or clear error-rate reduction.

Scorecard published; benefits show owner and financial math.

ROI Scoring (example)

Field	Weight	Example
Time saved / month (hrs)	0.4	80
Error reduction / mo (%)	0.2	60
Risk & compliance fit	0.2	Pass
Build effort (low/med/high)	0.2	Med
