Week05 â€” Day05: AI Security, Compliance & FinOps Deep Dive (CXO Edition)
Objectives

Build an AI threat model (data, model, prompt, supply chain) with mitigations.

Stand up FinOps guardrails: budgets, alerts, unit economics per experiment/app.

Extend controls: key management, DLP, access, data residency & DPIA.

Lesson Summary

AI must be safe and affordable. Combine threat modeling with cost discipline so the roadmap is sustainable.

Activities (90 min)

Threat model (35m): STRIDE-inspired + model risks (prompt injection, data exfil, drift).

FinOps (30m): Budgets per app, alerts, cost per token/call; showbacks.

Controls (25m): Keys, RBAC, DLP, residency; DPIA template & triggers.

Deliverables

security/ai_threat_model.md (diagram, attack surfaces, mitigations)

finance/finops_policy.md (budgets, alerts, tagging, showback)

governance/ai_cost_controls.md (guardrails by environment)

security/key_management_standards.md (rotation, vaulting, scope)

privacy/dpia_template.md (when/how to run)

Acceptance & QA

Cost alerts configured; unit cost baseline per pilot app.

Threat model lists top 10 risks with owners and mitigation dates.

DPIA template adopted; residency rules documented.
