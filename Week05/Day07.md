# Week05 — Day07: Capstone — Value Realization, OKRs & Scale Gate (CXO Edition)

## Objectives
- Produce a **capstone plan** (use-case, data, governance, rollout) ready for the **Scale Gate**.  
- Draft **OKRs** and a **value realization plan** with traceability to **P&L**.  
- Define **stage-gates** and criteria to graduate pilots to production at scale.

## Lesson Summary
Lock in value and governance so wins compound. If it can’t be measured and supported, it won’t scale.

## Activities (⏱ 75–90 min)
- **Capstone one-pager (30m):** Problem, solution, data, tech, security, people, timeline.  
- **OKRs & benefits (25m):** Quarterly OKRs tied to financials & customer outcomes.  
- **Scale gate (20m):** Criteria, evidence, rollback, support model, ownership.  
- **Sign-off prep (10–15m):** What the IC/Board needs to see.

## Deliverables
- `exec/capstone_onepager.md`  
- `exec/okr_draft.md`  
- `exec/value_realization_plan.md` (benefits traceability & KPI mapping)  
- `governance/scale_stage_gates.md` (criteria & evidence)  
- `ops/support_model.md` (on-call, SLOs, change control)

## Acceptance & QA
- Capstone approved to start next sprint (**Go / Conditional Go / No-Go** recorded).  
- OKRs have **owners, baselines, targets, dates**; value plan traces to **P&L line items**.  
- Scale gate lists **SLOs, telemetry, security sign-off, rollback**, and **comms plan**.
