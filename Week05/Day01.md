Week05 — Day01: Capital-Backed AI Portfolio & Investment Committee (CXO Edition)
Objectives

Convert priority use-cases into fundable investment cases (NPV/IRR/Payback; risk-adjusted).

Establish an AI Investment Committee (IC) charter, cadence, and stage gates.

Allocate capital across a balanced portfolio (Quick Wins, Productive Platforms, Strategic Bets).

Lesson Summary

Ideas don’t ship without capital and gates. Turn Month-One shortlists into financeable narratives, set hurdle rates, and publish a portfolio the Board can approve.

Activities (90 min)

Hurdle rates (15m): Discount rate, target IRR, payback window; non-financial guardrails (privacy, safety, brand).

Case drafting (40m): Build 3 briefs with base/bull/bear scenarios.

Portfolio balance (20m): Map to 2×2 (Impact × Certainty), cap per bucket, note dependencies.

IC mechanics (15m): Draft IC charter, calendar, and gate evidence.
