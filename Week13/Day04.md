Week13 — Day04: Threat Modeling & Adversarial Red-Teaming 2.0 (MITRE ATLAS)

Save as: wk13/day04_threat_modeling_red_team_2_0.md

CXO Lens: We graduate from prompt injection 101 to supply chain, data poisoning, retrieval contamination, agentic abuse, and exfiltration mapped to MITRE ATLAS.

Objectives

Build attack trees and coverage matrix across top use cases.

Expand red-team with poisoning datasets and supply-chain scenarios.

Prioritize fix backlog and add to MRM gates.

Activities (⏱ 75–90m)

Attack Trees (25m) — Goals, paths, controls; ATLAS mapping.

Scenario Packs (20m) — Poisoned corpora, compromised plugin, jailbreak chains.

Coverage Matrix (20m) — Which defenses exist; where to invest.

Fix Planning (10–25m) — Tickets with owners, SLAs, and eval hooks.

Deliverables

Acceptance & QA

At least 3 new scenarios executed with evidence and learned controls.

Coverage matrix reviewed by CISO + Product and added to MRM.
