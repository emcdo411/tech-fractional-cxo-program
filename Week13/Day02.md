Week13 — Day02: Regulatory Radar & Change Impact (Obligations → Controls)

Save as: wk13/day02_regulatory_radar_change_impact.md

CXO Lens: Risk is also policy drift. We track the AI Act, NIST AI RMF, sector regs, and state laws—then translate obligations into controls and audits.

Objectives

Stand up a Regulatory Radar with watch items and likelihood/impact.

Map obligations → current controls → gaps & remediation plan.

Create a change-control cadence for policy updates.

Activities (⏱ 75–90m)

Horizon Scan (25m) — EU AI Act categories, sector guidance, state privacy.

Obligation Mapping (20m) — Traceability, risk mgmt, human oversight, DPIAs.

Gap Plan (20m) — Owners, budgets, ETAs; interim compensating controls.

Cadence (10–25m) — Quarterly compliance council & attestation cycle.
