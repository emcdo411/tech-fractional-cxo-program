## ⚠️ Note on Affiliation
*“SMU CAPE–inspired”* means we mirror the rigor and executive tone of top programs. This project has **no affiliation** with SMU or any university.

---

## 🔎 Executive Summary
This program turns your repo into a **living portfolio** and training ground for Fractional Tech CXOs. You’ll execute real artifacts—board packs, governance matrices, risk runbooks, funding models, and 90-day transformations—demonstrating that you operate at **boardroom caliber** for startups and scale-ups.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By completion, you will be able to:
1. **Govern** early-stage tech with lightweight boards, charters, and operating cadence.  
2. **Model finance** (runway, CAC/LTV, scenario stress tests) to inform strategy.  
3. **Secure & de-risk** with a pragmatic cybersecurity baseline (MFA, Zero Trust, vendor risk).  
4. **Operate** via OKRs/KPIs, executive scorecards, and incident playbooks.  
5. **Communicate** with board-ready briefs, investor updates, and executive narratives.  
6. **Deliver** a portfolio of artifacts that prove Fractional CXO capability.
