Week11 — Day01: Independent Risk Charter & Operating Model (Three Lines for AI)

Save as: wk11/day01_risk_charter_operating_model.md

CXO Lens: Risk independence is non-negotiable. We install a 2nd Line that can veto scale decisions, owns the risk taxonomy, and reports to the Board Risk Committee—not to product or revenue.

Objectives

Ratify AI Risk Charter (mandate, scope, authority, reporting).

Define Three Lines for AI: 1st (Build/Run), 2nd (Risk), 3rd (Internal Audit).

Stand up AI Risk Committee (AIRC) cadence and decision rights.

Lesson Summary

No scale without independence. The AIRC approves risk appetite, limits, exceptions, and model deployments by tier. Risk function has direct board access, budget, and tools.

Activities (⏱ 75–90m)

Org & Mandate (25m) — Charter draft; reporting lines to CRO/Board Risk.

Decision Rights (20m) — What requires AIRC approval (e.g., Tier-3 agents).

Escalation & Exceptions (15m) — Breach process (who, when, proof).

Tooling & Data (15–30m) — Access to logs, evals, lineage, and spend.
